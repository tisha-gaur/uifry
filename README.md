# Uifry - A Web App Built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS

## Project Overview

Uifry is a single-page web application created using the latest web technologies. It features a sleek and user-friendly interface, adhering to the design principles outlined in our Figma design reference (link provided below).

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A high-performance development server that provides a seamless development experience.
- **React.js**: A widely-used JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that offers a robust and customizable foundation for styling components.

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (or yarn) are installed on your system. Verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal. If not installed, download them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
